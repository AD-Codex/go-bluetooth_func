# Bluetooth Control Terminal

## Overview

A Bluetooth control terminal for managing Bluetooth adapters and devices using BlueZ and Go Bluetooth libraries. This tool allows users to interact with Bluetooth adapters, make them discoverable, scan for devices, and perform device management tasks like connecting, disconnecting, pairing, and removing devices.

The program provides an interactive CLI interface to control Bluetooth operations on a system running BlueZ. It uses Go's concurrency features and BlueZ's D-Bus API to manage devices efficiently.

## Features

Power on/off Bluetooth adapter
Toggle discoverability of the Bluetooth adapter
Scan for available Bluetooth devices (both BLE and Classic)
Connect, disconnect, pair, and remove Bluetooth devices
Display current Bluetooth adapter properties

## Installation
